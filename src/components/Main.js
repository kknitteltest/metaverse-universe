           <p className="left">We decided to create more rooms for different instruments and give the ownership of these rooms to members of Anthony’s band meet-up group. 
              We also decided that this school is going to be for the public good of education and not for profit of the owners.</p>

            <p className="left">Congratulations to my FIRST client from the multiverse, Elvis, aka Tatatel on the closing of your house in Houston, TX What an amazing opportunity 
               I was given to help someone from the Multiverse buy a home. When I bought this Oculus, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would be doing 
               real life work from relationships built online. But it’s happening, we are living in the future and it’s absolutely amazing! 
               Thank you so much Tatatel for giving me the opportunity to help you and your family. 
               If anyone is looking for a realtor in Houston, I would love to help 281-702-0556</p>
